OK well let's try a challenge. The most-downloaded book from Gutenberg in the past 30 days is Frankenstein https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/84/pg84.txt

Print out the most common ten words in that text document with their counts. Words are separated by whitespace. Ignore case (so "book", "Book", and "BOOK" are the same word). If a word contains any digits, ignore it (so "123" or "x1" should be ignored). If a word contains a dash - or an apostrophe ' inside the word, leave it alone. Any other non-letter characters should be removed, including - or ' at the ends of words, so "monster's" and "go-to" are allowed, " monsters' " becomes "monsters", "foo,bar" becomes "foobar", "on-the-go-" becomes "on-the-go".

You can save the file locally and read it directly, download directly from the URL, feed to standard input, or anything else, your choice. Output can be plain text. HTML table, JSON, CSV file, screen of a phone app or programmable calculator, or anything else, your choice.

You can use any programming language and/or framework you like, but post the language, your solution and the output.
